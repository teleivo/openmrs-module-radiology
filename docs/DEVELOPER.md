## Overview

This guide should give any developer a quick reference of useful commands and
guidelines which are used in this module.

This document is work in progress :construction_worker:

Contributions are welcome!

## Build

The build tool used is [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)

### Plugins

#### License Header

We use http://code.mycila.com/license-maven-plugin/ which makes sure that every
java, xml, txt file has a correct OpenMRS license header. The license header
content is taken from license-header.txt the formatting depends on the file
type (java, xml, txt).

This plugin is automatically run on `mvn clean package/install` and fails on
travis CI if a file misses or doesnt have a correct license header.

##### Commands

_Add or update license header_

```bash
mvn license:format
```

_Check for wrong or missing license header_

```bash
mvn license:check
```

#### Formatter

We use https://github.com/velo/maven-formatter-plugin as source code formatter.

This plugin is automatically run on `mvn clean package/install` (not on travis
CI) and formats java files only. xmls have to be formatted
by you, so please configure your IDE formatter correctly.

Refer to [formatter guide](FORMATTER.md) on how to configure your
IDE.

##### Commands

_Format source code_

```bash
mvn formatter:format
```

#### Code Style

We have some rules about what we think is code with style :bowtie:

You can find the rules about java code in the `checkstyle.xml`.

This file is imported into [codacy](https://www.codacy.com/app/teleivo/openmrs-module-radiology_2/dashboard)
which we use to publicly display things we need to work on.

##### Commands

_Check source code for style_

If you want to check your changes locally, execute:

```bash
mvn checkstyle:checkstyle
```

This will generate html reports into

* `api/target/site/checkstyle.html`
* `omod/target/site/checkstyle.html`
